        🌐 2PM.Network: Privacy-Preserving AI Ecosystem
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        🚀 2PM.Network is a groundbreaking privacy-computing AI model ecosystem
        that leverages the security and validation services of any EVM
        blockchain. It's like a futuristic city where AI and privacy coexist in
        perfect harmony! 🏙️🤖
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        💡 Using the Story Protocol, 2PM.Network copyrights AI models and fairly
        distributes inference revenue to privacy data and computing power
        contributors. It's turning AI into a collaborative masterpiece where
        everyone gets credit! 🎨💰
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        🔗 By integrating with EigenLayer, 2PM.Network incentivizes users to
        stake and re-stake, encouraging node operators to run validation
        clients. It's like creating a neighborhood watch for data, computation
        processes, and results! 🕵️‍♀️🖥️
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        🧩 The beauty of 2PM.Network lies in its modularity. Anyone can build
        new privacy computing node networks based on the privacy computing
        framework and 2PM DAO. It's a DIY kit for creating cutting-edge AI
        systems! 🛠️🧠
